The text on the upper part of the graph shows the extreme (max or min) water level you can expect for the specified
return period T - in other words, the probability of reaching that extreme in any given year is 1/T. Greater T
means more conservative calculations. The calculations assume the data follows Gumbel distribution.
As a hydrologist, you might not want to use the entire data series to predict extreme values, since the older
data might not reflect the current conditions of the river. Therefore, choose the period for which you want to compute
the expected extreme values and the calculations will update automatically.
The plot shown above uses the manaus dataset, included in the boot package. It consists of a time series of
surface water elevations of Negro River, in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.
